## 🎯 Mock AI Intelligence

The mock agent understands:

### Categories
1. **Greetings:** hello, hi, hey, good morning
2. **Help:** what can you do, help, capabilities
3. **Actions:** send sms, call, make call, set alarm, create event
4. **Info:** calendar, schedule, weather, time
5. **Thanks:** thank you, thanks
6. **General:** Explains it's in demo mode

### Action Detection
When you mention these keywords, it requests confirmation:
- "send" + "sms" → SMS confirmation
- "call" → Phone call confirmation
- "alarm" or "reminder" → Alarm confirmation
- "event" or "meeting" → Calendar event confirmation

## 🔧 Architecture Highlights

### State Management (Provider)
```dart
AuthService          # Google authentication
VoiceInputService    # Speech recognition
ChatProvider         # Conversation & messages
```

## 🚀 What's Next?

### To Connect Real Backend:
1. Deploy your AI agent server
2. Update `useMockData: false` in `ChatProvider`
3. Set `AGENT_API_BASE_URL` in `.env`
4. Set `AGENT_API_KEY` in `.env`
5. Agent API should match the interface in `agent_api_client.dart`

### To Implement Real Actions:
1. Create platform channels in `android/` and `ios/`
2. Implement native code for SMS, calls, alarms
3. Update action handlers in `ChatProvider`
4. Test on real devices (required for SMS/calls)

## 💡 Tips

### For Best Testing:
- **Use Chrome** for quick testing (voice may not work)
- **Use Android/iOS device** for full features (voice, actions)
- **Check console** for debug messages and errors
- **Try edge cases** like empty messages, rapid clicking

### Known Limitations (Mock Mode):
- ❌ Voice input may not work in web browser
- ❌ Google Sign-In may have CORS issues on web
- ❌ Actions are simulated, not executed
- ✅ All UI features work everywhere
- ✅ All flow and logic work correctly
